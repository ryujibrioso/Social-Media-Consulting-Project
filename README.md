# Project Background
A YouTube Channel, with the first upload in May 2024, uploads both short-form and long-form content onto YouTube as their main platform. Recently, however, this channel has been stagnating, arguably on a downward trend, no longer generating revenue for the client.

The channel has a significant amount of data on its engagement (views, impressions, ctr, watch time), revenue, net subscriber growth, and content type that previously hasn't been utilized to its fullest potential. This project thoroughly analyzes and synthesizes this data in order to uncover critical insights that will help formulate a content creation strategy that will improve this channel's success in both channel growth and revenue.

Insights and recommendations are provided on the following key areas:
- **Growth Trends Analysis:** Evaluation on historical patterns, by content type and engagement, focusing on Net Subscriber Growth, Impressions, and CTR (Click Through Rate).
- **Content Type Performance:** An analysis of both short-form & long-form content, understanding their impact growth and revenue.
- **Video Duration Success:** An assessment of how video duration (for long-form) affects engagement & revenue.
- **Scheduling Comparisons:** An evaluation of when the best time to put out a certain content type is.
